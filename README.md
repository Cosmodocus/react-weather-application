# 🌦️ Weather App Brainstorm

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- OpenWeatherMap's API

## 📚 What I Will Need and Learn
- React Fundamentals:
  - JSX, components, props, conditional rendering, list rendering, ES6+ methods, event listeners, useState, useEffect, Error Handling (try/catch)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-classes, responsive design, maybe presets, etc)
- Asynchronous Programming
- API Integration
- UI/UX Design Principles
- Debugging & Troubleshooting
- Problem Solving Techniques

## 🛠️ My Resources & Tools
- VS Code Editor (of course)
- AI Assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Perplexity)
- Google
- YouTube
- Documentations (Tailwind Docs, React Docs, OpenWeatherMap API Docs, etc)
- Free Source/Asset Websites (logos, images, icons, designs, pngs, jpgs, svgs, etc)
- GitHub
- Notepad (writing out thoughts, problems, etc)

## 🎯 Goal
Keep it simple, and when it runs as intended, continue to develop and grow it.

## 🔍 What I Will Need to Gather First
- API Key
- Important Documentations
- AI Assistants
- Proper setup (React with Vite, Tailwind CSS)
- All Assets to be used (logos, icons, images, designs, etc)

## 🖼️ Ok, Here's How I'm Imagining the Display
- A container with a search bar on the top
- A display of icons depending on the weather
- The temperature of the weather in Celsius instead of Fahrenheit
- Other important weather stats (humidity, wind speed, etc)

## 📝 What to Do For Now
- **What I've Utilized and Done So Far:**
  - useState (location, weatherIcon)
  - async functions
  - handle functions and event listeners (onChange, onKeyDown, onClick)
  - API integration with OpenWeatherMap
  - Display name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
  - Import weather display icons
  - Error handling for handleSearch function
- **What Needs Work:**
  - UI/UX Design & Styling (Pretty weak and bland currently)
  - Error Handling for both empty and incorrect value in Searchbar
  - More features/functionalities (precipitation, other API data, sunset/sunrise, maybe time region?)
  - More Comments
  - Error with names (Canada has a weird accent on the n)
  - Add weather description
  - Safely store API-key elsewhere

## 📝 Notes 1 Reflection
- I did use a lot of ChatGPT for help, but not before I at least tried it on my own. It did solve a lot of syntax issues and gaps in understanding.
- I never copy-pasted the code AI assistants gave but tried to understand it before implementing it.
- I'm still struggling to understand how I can implement error handling for search tasks. One for empty input, and another for incorrect values.
- I mostly focused on the functionality, as I feel that the design can wait.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the Weather App project, including its goals, required resources, current progress, and areas for improvement. It serves as a guide for both development and collaboration on the project.
